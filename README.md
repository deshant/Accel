Accel
-----
**Accel** is a simple android app, which uses mobile's built-in 3 axis accelerometer to detect free fall of device.
In case of a major free fall, the app calculates free fall's approximate duration, as well as speed at the end of fall.


*A simple project to understand Accelerometer's working*.
